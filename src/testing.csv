Soazig  Le Bihan,University of Montana - Missoula,Philosophy department,07/17/2017,1,4,"Took 100 level class for Ethics offered online as an option to fill a core requirement She was terrible! Did not seem to have a grasp of the English language nor does she seem to have a grasp on reality as she insisted many times that failure in an ENTRY LEVEL, OPTIONAL class is very common due to the ""difficulty"" of material, very full of herself",F

Soazig  Le Bihan,University of Montana - Missoula,Philosophy department,07/29/2009,5,5,"She is an extremely demanding professor. The work load is a big one. But she is also extremely helpful and explains things very clearly. She\'s not a professor for slackers... not and easy A, but definitely not impossible. Show up. Pay attention. Ask for help.",F
Gyda  Swayney,University of Montana - Missoula,Psychology department,01/23/2010,3,2,"Boo. When I took multicultural psych from Dr. Swaney it was more like Salish Psych. The first day (of a 300 level class!) we went over APA style guidelines and how to use blackboard. She\'s a nice person, but should not be teaching at a college level.",F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,07/22/2015,5,3,Steph was very helpful and cared about our experience. She wanted to be sure we learned and were comfortable with everything before our testing. Go to her office hours if you need help. I learned a lot.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,07/22/2015,5,2,One of the best classes I took at UM.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,01/16/2013,1,4,"Stephanie ALWAYS had a mad or bored or ""I could be doing so many better things with my time right now than babysitting these college students"" look on her face. When a student asked a question, she quickly breezed over a vague explanation and speededly moved to the next subject. She is extremely unapproachable and cold, and ""tricky.""",F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,05/06/2010,4.5,4,"She was awesome! If you went to class and listened actively good grades were easy to get. She is extremely helpful to anyone who actually goes out to seek help. My advice show up to class, ask questions and go to office hours if you need more help.",F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,01/24/2010,1.5,5,Horrible. I went to class everyday and it still didn\'t make a difference. Her tests do not reflect her level of teaching.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,12/15/2009,3.5,3,I thought she did great. The PP slides just mean you don\'t have to write notes yourself. She is a joy to have as a teacher if you PARTICIPATE and SHOW UP TO CLASS!!! People who **** are the ones who never show up. She can be very funny & I enjoyed this class very much.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,12/05/2009,1.5,4,terrible!,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,12/03/2009,2,5,"she talks too fast, she doesn\'t do anything in the class--she doesn\'t make her own slides, she has her TA\'s grade everything, so if you have a problem with a grade, don\'t go talk to her... she has no say in the grades. print off the slides for each lecture! they always stay the same.",F
