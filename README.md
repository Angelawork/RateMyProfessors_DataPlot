# RateMyProfessors_DataPlot
üìôThis final project takes inspiration from an assignment created by Juliette Woodrow, Kathleen Creel, and
Nick Bowman from Stanford University.
For this project you will write several classes to help you parse and store a complex dataset of college
professor reviews. You will then use this structured data together with the graphical tool provided in order
to plot word frequency data across review quality and professor gender to reveal interesting trends about
biases in language usage.At the heart of this assignment is a dataset collected from the popular website RateMyProfessors.com ‚úèÔ∏è

# PART - 1: Your Own Hash Table
Let‚Äôs start by implementing your own Hash table. To do so, you need to complete the file MyHashTable.java
which was provided to you. To do so, you should first familiarize yourself with the provided MyPair
class. 

# PART - 2: Let‚Äôs Analyze Some Data!
One of the most common applications of hashmaps is probably data analysis. For this project, we want
you to build some handy tools to help us visualize the data collected.
